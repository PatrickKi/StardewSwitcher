# StardewSwitcher 1.0

This is a tool that helps you switch the host of a co-op world in Stardew Valley.

## How to use

- Download tool for windows - no install needed - see Releases on Github
  - Unzip the folder and start .exe
- Click on "Choose saves directory" to select your saves folder
  - Usually here: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\StardewValley\Saves
  - Select the whole "saves" folder, not one specific world
- Choose a world you want to change
- Choose a farmhand ("other player") that you want as the new host
- Click "Make main player and save as new folder"
  - The tool **creates a new folder and does not change the original in any way** (you should still make a backup just in case)
